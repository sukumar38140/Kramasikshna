### Technical Design Plan
#### Frontend
- *Framework*: React.js with TypeScript for a responsive, dynamic UI.
- *UI Library*: TailwindCSS for modern, clean styling (similar to Tech Stories of Srinidhi clone).
- *Components*:
  - *Registration/Login Page*: Form with email, password, and OAuth (Google/GitHub login).
  - *Dashboard*: Displays active challenges, streak counter, progress graphs, and badges.
  - *Task Creation Form*:
    - Fields: Task name, category, duration (default/custom), daily timing, optional image upload.
    - Disable delete button post-creation.
  - *Progress Tracker*: Calendar view showing completed, missed ("No Action"), and pending tasks.
  - *Shareable Link Page*: View-only page with user’s tasks, hours, and images (no edit access).
  - *Completion Screen*: Animated "Congratulations! Your Discipline Never Fails!" message with confetti effects.
- *Responsive Design*: Mobile-friendly with a dedicated PWA (Progressive Web App) for app-like experience.

#### Backend
- *Framework*: Node.js with Express.js for REST API.
- *Database*: MongoDB for permanent storage of tasks, user data, and progress.
  - Schema:
    javascript
    User: { email, password, name, challenges: [Challenge] }
    Challenge: { name, category, duration, startDate, tasks: [Task], progress: [Progress] }
    Task: { title, timing, imageURL, createdAt, editable: false }
    Progress: { date, hoursSpent, status: "Completed" | "No Action", mood }
    
- *Storage*: AWS S3 for storing task images (non-deletable).
- *Authentication*: JWT for secure login, OAuth for Google/GitHub.
- *Permanent Storage*:
  - Tasks and progress stored in MongoDB with a unique user ID.
  - Shareable link generated as a public URL (e.g., discipline-never-fails.com/user/sukumar38140/progress).
  - View-only access enforced via read-only API endpoints.

#### Email Reminders
- *Tool*: Nodemailer or SendGrid for sending daily reminders.
- *Logic*:
  - Cron job runs daily to check user task timings.
  - Send email with task details and motivational quote (e.g., "Day 5: Keep pushing, Sukumar!").
  - Example Email:
    
    Subject: Your Daily Discipline Reminder
    Hi Sukumar,
    It's time for your 8:00 AM task: "Learn Python (21-Day Challenge)".
    Quote of the Day: "Discipline is the bridge between goals and success."
    Log your progress: [Link to Dashboard]
    

#### Shareable Link
- *Implementation*:
  - Generate a unique URL per user (e.g., /progress/:userId).
  - API endpoint returns tasks, hours, images, and completion status in read-only format.
  - Frontend displays data in a visually appealing timeline or gallery (no edit/delete buttons).
- *Security*:
  - No authentication required for link access, but no modification APIs exposed.
  - Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS).

#### Performance Reviews
- *Logic*:
  - Weekly/monthly cron job analyzes user progress:
    - Completion rate: (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) * 100.
    - Missed days: Count of "No Action" entries.
  - Generate review messages:
    - 90%+ completion: "You're a discipline superstar! Keep shining!"
    - 50-89%: "Great effort, but consistency is key. Push harder!"
    - <50%: "Don't give up! Recommit and conquer your challenge."
  - Send via email and display in dashboard.

#### GitHub-Like Storage
- *Approach*:
  - Instead of GitHub, use MongoDB for data storage with a Git-like version history.
  - Each task update (hours, images) creates a new version in the database.
  - Shareable link displays versioned data in a timeline (e.g., "Day 1: 2 hours, image uploaded").
- *Alternative*: If GitHub integration is needed:
  - Create a private GitHub repo per user (via GitHub API).
  - Store progress as JSON files and commit daily.
  - Generate a public view-only link for progress (less practical, so MongoDB preferred).

### Development Steps
1. *Setup Project*:
   - Initialize React + Node.js project.
   - Install dependencies: react, express, mongodb, nodemailer, aws-sdk.
   - Folder structure:

     ├── server/ (Express backend)
     ├── shared/ (Common types/interfaces)
     ├── package.json
     ├── tsconfig.json
     ├── vite.config.ts (for React)
     
2. *Build Frontend*:
   - Create components: Login, Dashboard, TaskForm, ProgressTracker, CompletionScreen.
   - Use TailwindCSS for styling.
   - Implement PWA for mobile access.
3. *Build Backend*:
   - Setup MongoDB connection.
   - Create APIs: /register, /login, /tasks, /progress, /share/:userId.
   - Integrate AWS S3 for image uploads.
   - Setup cron jobs for email reminders and reviews.
4. *Testing*:
   - Test task creation, non-deletable tasks, email reminders, and shareable links.
   - Ensure "No Action" marking for missed tasks.
   - Verify completion message and performance reviews.
5. *Deployment*:

  - Preview of schedule before saving (non-editable post-save).
- *Completion Screen*:
  - Full-screen animation with confetti and badge unlock.
  - Shareable certificate: "Sukumar completed a 21-Day Python Challenge!"
- *Shareable Link Page*:
  - Timeline view: Day 1 (2 hours, image), Day 2 (No Action), etc.
  - Visual stats: Pie chart of completion rate, total hours spent.

### Additional Notes
- *Inspiration from Web Results*:
  - *Challenger App* (): Simple, action-oriented UI with progress tracking and reminders.[](https://www.challengersapp.com/)
  - *21 Days Challenge App* (): Positive notifications and mood tracking, which I included as creative additions.[](https://21dayschallengeapp.com/)
  - *HabitBull* (): Customizable reminders and streak tracking, inspiring the gamification features.[](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-bull-daily-goal-planner/id1041482672)
- *Scalability*:
  - MongoDB scales well for user data.
  - Vercel/Render free tiers support initial deployment; upgrade for heavy traffic.
- *Security*:
  - Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, emails) with bcrypt.
  - Use HTTPS for all APIs and shareable links.
  - Rate-limit APIs to prevent abuse.
- *Cost*:
  - Free tier tools (Vercel, Render, MongoDB Atlas, SendGrid) for development.
  - Domain (~$10/year) is the only cost.
- *License Check*:
  - Ensure tasks or challenges created by users don’t infringe on copyrighted content.
  - Use MIT License for your codebase (open-source on GitHub).
